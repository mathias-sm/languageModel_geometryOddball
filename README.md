## A playground where I try to model behavioural data

The data is not public, so there's only so much you can do with this
repository. It requires a bunch of python module:

```
docopt tqdm numpy matplotlib psutil scikit-optimize
```

More to come. Part of my PhD at @Neurospin under the supervision of Stanislas
Dehaene.
